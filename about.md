<p class="message">
  Hey there! This page still a work in progress. I'll let you know when it's finished.
</p>


## Who are you?
I'm just a 22-year-old spanish guy with a degree in Mathematics.
 
## Why are you writing this?
Well, there are a few reasons for the existence of this blog. One of them would be because I want to
write about things that I enjoy. Practising my English is the other reason, and that is why most of 
this is wirtten in English despite being Spanish myself.
 
## What other things do you usually do?
I enjoy playing video games and you can check my Steam profile clicking on the icon in the sidebar.
Feel free to add me if you want to hang out.

I also code little things in Python (nothing big, I'm still a beginner) which will probably have their
own tab on the sidebar or have their own repository on GitHub.

 
## Where can I find you?
You can find all my social links on the left sidebar.

## How was this blog made?
This blog is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is powered by [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon),
a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme which also has some elements from [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
The comment system is provided by [disqus](https://www.disqus.com).

If you have any questions about the blog's system, just ask them or you can look it up yourself by
forking the repository on GitHub.
